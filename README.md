# Statistical_Modelling_Price_Used_Vehicle

## Introduction
Owning a car is typically quite expensive, yet it is deemed a necessity by many households, especially in North America. In a 2021 study, 276 million vehicles were found to be registered with the US Department of Transportation. Additionally, 90% of US households have access to a vehicle and the average person was found to spend 100 minutes a day in a car (Borrelli, 2021). This highlights the significance of vehicles in our lives and the importance of selecting the correct vehicle.  

The used car market is of particular interest as, according to insights from McKinsey & Company, “the US used-car market is more than twice the size of the new-car segment and is outpacing it in growth” (Ellencweig et.al, 2019). The used car market in the United States may grow by close to 4 million units in the next 4 years (Yahoo!, August 2021). Additionally, purchasing a used car involves a more complicated decision making process than a new vehicle. As such, “used-car buyers spend about 40 percent more time researching online during the buying process than new-car buyers do” (Ellencweig et.al, 2019).  

There are many factors that will affect the cost of a car. In order to be conscientious consumers, we were interested in investigating the independent variables that can potentially influence the prices of cars. In this report, we investigate the various features from the “US Cars Data Set” (Alsenani, 2019) such as the vehicle registration year, state, brand, model, mileage, status (clean or used), etc.  

There are a number of commonly known factors that impact an individual’s decision when buying a used vehicle and affect the price. For example, a car with a clean title (no reported major accidents) will likely be worth more than one with salvage or rebuild status (has been in accident). Vehicles with higher mileage will have a lower resale price compared with vehicles with lower mileage (see the following figure). These assumptions were verified and quantified by conducting appropriate statistical tests.
Furthermore, we were interested to see if the price will be impacted by including interaction variables. For example, can both mileage and age of car together play a key role in the price prediction of a vehicle?  

All of these factors were considered using methodologies learned in DATA 603, including hypothesis testing, model diagnostics, ANOVA, etc. The results of these findings were used to find the best multiple linear regression model to predict the price of a vehicle in the United States.
